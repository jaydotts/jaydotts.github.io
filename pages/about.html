            Welcome to my website!
            <br>
            I'm Jade. I created this site so I can share cool stuff with my friends 
            while also having lots of fun learning web design.
            <br>
            In the future, I hope to post about my electronics projects, photography, and anything else I think is worth sharing.
            <br>
            Thanks for stopping by :)
